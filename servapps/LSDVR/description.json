  "longDescription": [
    "<p>- Automatic VOD recording around when the stream goes live, instead of checking it every minute like many other scripts do.</p>",
    "<p>- Because of notification delays, the stream usually starts capturing after ~2 minutes after the stream goes live.</p>",
    "<p>- Cyclic recording, as in when a specified amount or storage per streamer is reached, the oldest stream gets deleted.</p>",
    "<p>- Tons of metadata, maybe too much. Stores info about games played, stream titles, duration, if the stream got muted from copyrighted music, etc.</p>",
    "<p>- Viewer count logging with graphs.</p>",
    "<p>- Chapters (titles and games) are written to the final video file.</p>",
    "<p>- <a href='https://github.com/MrBrax/twitch-vod-chat'>Video player</a> with chat playback.</p>",
    "<p>- Video cutter with chapter display for easy exporting, also cuts the downloaded chat for synced rendering.</p>",
    "<p>- Notifications with optional speech when the website is open, get stream live notifications far earlier than the mobile app does.</p>",
    "<p>- Writes a <a href='https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/'>losslesscut</a> compatible csv file for the full VOD, so you don't have to find all the games.</p>",
    "<p>- Uses `ts` instead of `mp4` so if the stream or program crashes, the file won't be corrupted.</p>",
    "<p>- Audio only support.</p>",
    "<p>- Optionally either dumps chat while capturing or downloads the chat file after it's done.</p>",
    "<p>- Basic tools for downloading any VOD, chat, or clip.</p>",
    "<p>- Can be set to automatically download the whole stream chat to a JSON file, to be used in my <a href='https://github.com/MrBrax/twitch-vod-chat'>twitch-vod-chat</a> webapp or automatically burned in with <a href='https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader'>TwitchDownloader</a>.</p>",
    "<p>- Basic webhook support for external scripting.</p>",
    "<p>- Notifications over the browser, telegram, pushover, and discord.</p>",
    "<p>- Mobile friendly site with PWA.</p>",
    "<p>- Exporting of videos to external file, SFTP, and YouTube.</p>",
    "<p>- Can be enabled for all finished captures</p>",
    "<p>- Can be run for an entire channel at once</p>"
